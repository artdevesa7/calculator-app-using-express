our first web application.

not a static website with all of our information only on the client side for users to see.

now our code will reside on the server-side

making our code run server side.

So when our web site makes a request to our server, it's going to execute the code and only deliver the

outcome back to the user, so the user doesn't get to see any of the code and logic of our propietary algorithms.

It's all done on our server.

And once we grasp this concept, then we'll be able to make much faster, more complex web sites that can

do computation before it even renders the web site to be delivered to the user,

and we'll be able to interact with databases, and query, and search, and manipulate our databases, and create

much more interesting web applications.

Follow the steps below to complete the challenge:

1. Create a new file called bmiCalculator.html inside the Calculator folder from the last challenge 

2. Add the HTML boilerplate and set the page title to BMI Calculator

3. Add an HTML form, this form will make a post request to our server at the route /bmicalculator. The form will have 2 inputs, weight and height with placeholder text that tell the user what they should type into which text box. 

4. Add a button which says “Caculate BMI”

5. Add the get and post methods for the /bmicalculator route into the same server.js file we've been using

6. Use sendFile() to send the bmiCalculator.html page as a response inside the get method.

6. Add an h1 that says BMI Calculator

7. Inside server.js , create 2 variables, one for weight and one for height. 

8. Use the BMI calculator code you wrote previously, or write some new code to calculate and send back the result as text. It should read something like "Your BMI is n" where n is equal to the calculated BMI based on their weight and height inputs.
